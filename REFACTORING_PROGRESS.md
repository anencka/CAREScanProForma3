   - Exam volume by year (bar chart)
   - Revenue vs. expenses by year (bar chart)
   - Top exams by revenue (bar chart)
   - Exam volume distribution (pie chart)
   - Detailed data tables with formatting

4. Error handling for calculations and visualizations

To test the refactored tabs:

1. Run the application using:
   ```bash
   streamlit run refactored_app.py
   ```

2. Navigate to the "Revenue", "Equipment", "Personnel", and "Exams" tabs to verify functionality

## Next Steps: Refactoring the Other Expenses Tab

The next step is to refactor the Other Expenses Tab. Follow these steps:

1. Create ui/other_expenses_tab.py

2. Extract the other expenses-related code from app.py

3. Implement render_other_expenses_tab() following the same pattern as the other refactored tabs

4. Update ui/__init__.py to include the other expenses tab

5. Test the refactored other expenses tab

6. Update REFACTORING_PROGRESS.md to reflect the completion

## Refactoring Pattern

When refactoring each tab, follow this general pattern:

1. Create the appropriate UI module file (e.g., ui/tab_name.py)

2. Implement the main render function (e.g., render_tab_name)

3. Break down the functionality into smaller functions as appropriate

4. Use the AppController to access and store data

5. Use the visualization module for plotting functions

6. Test thoroughly to ensure all original functionality is preserved

7. Update ui/__init__.py to include the new module

## Tips for Successful Refactoring

1. **Incremental Approach**: Refactor one tab at a time

2. **Comprehensive Testing**: Test each refactored component thoroughly

3. **Maintain State**: Use AppController for consistent state management

4. **Separation of Concerns**: Keep UI rendering separate from business logic

5. **Documentation**: Update documentation as you progress
