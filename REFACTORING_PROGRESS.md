   ```

2. Navigate to the "Revenue", "Equipment", "Personnel", "Exams", and "Other Expenses" tabs to verify functionality

## Next Steps: Refactoring the Comprehensive ProForma Tab

The next step is to refactor the Comprehensive ProForma Tab. Follow these steps:

1. Create ui/comprehensive_tab.py

2. Extract the comprehensive proforma-related code from app.py

3. Implement render_comprehensive_tab() following the same pattern as the other refactored tabs

4. Update ui/__init__.py to include the comprehensive proforma tab

5. Test the refactored comprehensive proforma tab

6. Update REFACTORING_PROGRESS.md to reflect the completion

## Refactoring Pattern

When refactoring each tab, follow this general pattern:

1. Create the appropriate UI module file (e.g., ui/tab_name.py)

2. Implement the main render function (e.g., render_tab_name)

3. Break down the functionality into smaller functions as appropriate

4. Use the AppController to access and store data

5. Use the visualization module for plotting functions

6. Test thoroughly to ensure all original functionality is preserved

7. Update ui/__init__.py to include the new module

## Tips for Successful Refactoring

1. **Incremental Approach**: Refactor one tab at a time

2. **Comprehensive Testing**: Test each refactored component thoroughly

3. **Maintain State**: Use AppController for consistent state management

4. **Separation of Concerns**: Keep UI rendering separate from business logic

5. **Documentation**: Update documentation as you progress
